## Welcome to bot grid trading

I started this guide as personal reference and for my wife whom I have been trying to teach the art of grid trading. I have been trading and hodling crypto currency since 2017 but only tried bot grid trading in 2020.

All the content here are from my personal experience doing bot grid trading and should not be taken as a financial advice. Use your own due diligence when using the content here. Your money, your responsibility. 

## What is bot grid trading? 

There are two terms here **bot** and **grid trading**. A bot is a tool that performs task autonomously. Here we will use a bot to automate the placing of order in grid trading. To effectively describe grid trading I would need to define some ideas and technique first. 

### But low, sell high

This is perhaps the most basic and oldest principle in trading. Buy an entity at a price and sell it higher, the difference from the buy and sell is the gain. So if you buy 1 BTC at $8,000 and sell it later for $10,000, then your gain is $2,000. 

The problem with this (all-in) technique is when the sell price you set is not reached. So for our example above, you won't be able to sell if the price only reached $9,000. You'll have to wait a little bit longer if the price went down again after reaching $9,000. What traders do is do ladder tradding

### Ladder trading

In this technique, instead of selling all of the BTC at $10,000. You can divide it and sell it on different price levels or the ladder. So for our previous example, let's say you decide to sell in 4 equal amount (0.25) 

| Sell Price    | Quantity      | Gain  |
| ------------: |--------------:| -----:|
| $8,500        | 0.25          | $125  |
| $9,000        | 0.25          | $250  |
| $9,500        | 0.25          | $375  |
| $10,000       | 0.25          | $500  |

So instead of gaining $2,000, with ladder trading, you only gained $1,250. However, if the price only reached $9,000 you still gain $375 with ladder trading while you gain nothing with the all-in approach. 

The problem with ladder technique is if upon buying the price went down. You need to wait again for the price to go up before you can trade. 

### Grid trading

Grid trading like ladder trading but instead of buying.
